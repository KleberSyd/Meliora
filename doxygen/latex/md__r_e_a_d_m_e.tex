R University is an interactive web application that demonstrates a dynamic counting mechanism, showcasing the seamless integration of educational features with the exploration of mathematical concepts. Developed using Blazor technology and styled with Bootstrap, this application provides a responsive and engaging user experience.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Dynamic Counting}}\+: Counts from 1 to a user-\/defined limit.
\item {\bfseries{Special Labels}}\+: Marks multiples of 3 as "{}\+Nursing"{}, multiples of 7 as "{}\+Meliora"{}, and multiples of both 3 and 7 as "{}\+Nursing Meliora"{}.
\item {\bfseries{Interactivity}}\+: Users can start, stop, and resume counting at any time.
\item {\bfseries{Responsive Design}}\+: Optimized for a smooth experience across all devices.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ clone\ https://github.com/KleberSyd/Meliora.git}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Navigate to the project directory 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ Meliora}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item To build and start the application using Docker Compose, create a {\ttfamily docker-\/compose.\+yml} file in the project root with the following content\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{version:\ '3.8'}
\DoxyCodeLine{services:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ webapp:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ build:\ .}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ ports:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ -\/\ "{}80:80"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ environment:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ -\/\ ASPNETCORE\_ENVIRONMENT=Development}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Run the application 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{docker-\/compose\ up\ -\/-\/build}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will build the Docker image of the application (if necessary) and start a container based on that image.
\item Access the application in your browser at {\ttfamily \href{http://localhost}{\texttt{ http\+://localhost}}}.
